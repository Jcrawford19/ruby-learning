### Development
---

### Architecture
---

#### Client-side Javascript
- CoffeeScript for JavaScript Abstraction

#### Database

#### Testing
- Tests are written with RSpec in spec/ folder
    - ```bin/rspec```
- Factories via Factory Girl in spec/factories
- Types
    - Controllers

### Debugging
---
- For easier debugging commands in pry, simply create ~/.pryrc with the following lines...

    ```
    if defined?(PryByebug)
      Pry.commands.alias_command 'c', 'continue'
      Pry.commands.alias_command 's', 'step'
      Pry.commands.alias_command 'n', 'next'
      Pry.commands.alias_command 'f', 'finish'
    end
    ```

### Troubleshooting
---
#### Could not find bcrypt though bundler installed correctly
- Need to locate spring server ```ps aux | grep spring```
- Kill the process ```kill 12345```
